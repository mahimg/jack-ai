### Jack.aI is a chat bot made on MyPolly and uses a custom API.
What if you get knowledge on messenger?


Students can ask questions related to anything ranging from class 5th mathematics to higher studies tough question through Messages. 
Whenever some user finds time, he/she can try to answer random questions or particular questions for which they have the question ID. 
When some user finds some difficult questions, he might have to go through many text books (pdf copies) and articles on the internet to make sure what they are writing is not wrong or misleading. 
This way, the users who are answering to random question are also learning and the person whoâ€™s reading the content is learning something too.


Users are not wasting their free time by unnecessary discussions with other online users. 
Rather, they are reading or writing something while interacting with a chatbot.

 You may find some amazing answers from people, who will inspire you and will guide you towards a better you everyday.

You have an option of asking anything, literally anything and you will get answers from relevant people in moment's notice. Isn't  that a life changing utility tool.
